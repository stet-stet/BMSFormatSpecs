# BMSFormatSpecs

I will compile the specs(partly) for the BMS format here in markdown format.

## This list is for personal use

I have plans to make a BMS parser with C++11.
This list is to be used as a reference for that parser.

## Caution

This is in no way a comprehensive list of all available features.
I will primarily list features included in a BMS made with [ÂµBMSC](https://github.com/zardoru/iBMSC).
For a more complete list, please refer to [this](https://hitkey.nekokan.dyndns.info/cmds.htm) instead.
